Based on my observations while preprocessing the data here are the few Data Quality Issues in the Data provided.
1. Data has a lot of null values. A lot of preprocessing needs to be done to fill these values or drop these values. 
2. In User data there are 283 duplicate values, ideally User_Id needs to be distinct. 
3. In Receipts and User Data 'date' columns are in UNIX timestamp format, which needs to be converted into standard DateTime format. 
4. Barcodes in the brand's data are not unique. Data has duplicate values. 
5. In Brand Data there are missing values for TopBrand and Brand code columns. This Data is important to have accurate information. 
6. There were some barcodes that were not in the Brand file but available in receipt data. 
7. RewardsReceiptItemList Data need to be extracted from Receipts data and there is a lot of missing values in the data. 
8. RewardsReceiptItemList Data doesn't have a unique identifier.
